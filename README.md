# movie-app-frontend
This is a my pet project called movie-app. This web application has JWT role-based authentication. The main idea of this web application is to create a simple CMS for managing films, their genres, actors, and movie theaters where they will be shown. Additionally, this application has the opportunity to publish films that will be released soon.
